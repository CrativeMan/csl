## ## CSL the CrativeStandardLibrary

Basically just a tiny project to help me with learning and understanding the `c` language more.
You can use it by just simply cloning the projects master branch or copying the `csl` folder.
`csl` is a header only library so no linking or building required, just including the header files wherever needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the only platform i am sure it is working on is linux but as it is only header files, most of the functionallity should translate just as well to Windows or MacOs
